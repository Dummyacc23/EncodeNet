# EnocodeNet
This Git repository provides the source code of EncodeNet, "Toward Low-Latency and Energy-Efficient DNN
Inferencing at the Edge".  EncodeNet is an energy-effiecient framework that enables faster inferencing and high throughput.

# Training contains the code of both simple autoencoder for MNIST and convolutional autoencoder for CIFAR10. 

#Measuring Energy on Raspberry Pi 4 : 
Please use the this git repository https://github.com/kolinger/rd-usb that creates an interface to collect the log files. Then please utilize /Sample_logfiles_energy/Energy_data_script.py to measure the average power consumption between two time stamps.
